![LibNav Banner](https://placehold.co/1000x300/0b1121/ffc4d6?text=LibNav+Project)

**LibNav** is a modern, static web application designed to help students and visitors locate books within a library. It is built as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using pure Vanilla JavaScript, requiring no backend server.

The system is optimized for **Mobile Devices** (PWA support) and **Public Library Kiosks** (Auto-reset & Screensaver features).
